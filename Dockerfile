    #### I find myself needing root too frequently. Just run as root and accept
    #### that containers are disposable and easily replaced. Keep this here
    #### just in case we decide to go back to running as a non-root user:
    # && addgroup -g 82 -S squish; \
    #   adduser -u 82 -D -S -G squish squish \
    # && echo "export PS1='[booksquisher]$ '" > /home/squish/.bashrc \
